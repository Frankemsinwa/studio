- Homepage Animation: Homepage 3D Animation: Fullscreen golden 3D number '5' slowly rotating, inviting users to 'Enter the Vibe'.
- Flavor Parallax: Flavor Parallax: High-quality food images with Afrobeat-animated spice particles and steam. Hover interactions reveal ingredients and play culinary sound bites.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#FFD700) to represent luxury and the rich culinary experience.
- Background color: Midnight Black (#0B0B0E) for a sophisticated and immersive dark mode experience.
- Accent color: Royal Purple (#9B3EFF) to add a vibrant and modern twist, drawing inspiration from the brand's dynamic identity. Pepper Red can be applied selectively on some ui elements, but avoid overuse.
- Employ bold headings to capture attention and clear, readable body text for accessibility. Prefer Inter over Satoshi because it is the more established web standard.
- Prioritize a desktop-first approach with responsive design to ensure seamless adaptation across devices, maintaining the immersive visual experience.
- Implement parallax scrolling, fluid transitions, and synchronized sound elements to enrich the storytelling and engage users deeply.
